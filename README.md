Developed a YOLO-based crowd counting algorithm was able to count crowds accurately and efficiently, even in challenging conditions such as low resolution images, Using Python and used the TensorFlow deep learning framework

I developed a YOLO-based crowd counting algorithm that achieved real-time performance on a GPU. The algorithm was trained on a dataset of over 1 million images and evaluated on a variety of datasets. The algorithm was able to count crowds accurately and efficiently, even in challenging conditions such as low resolution images or occlusions. The algorithm was implemented in Python and used the TensorFlow deep learning framework.

Here are some of the specific steps involved in the project:

Data collection: I collected a dataset of over 1 million images of crowds. The images were collected from a variety of sources, including the internet and public datasets.

Data preprocessing: I preprocessed the images to remove noise and improve the accuracy of the algorithm. This included steps such as resizing the images, cropping them, and converting them to grayscale.

Model training: I trained the algorithm on the preprocessed images using the TensorFlow deep learning framework. The algorithm was trained for several hours on a GPU.

Model evaluation: I evaluated the algorithm on a variety of datasets to measure its accuracy and performance. The algorithm was able to count crowds accurately and efficiently, even in challenging conditions such as low resolution images or occlusions.

Implementation: I implemented the algorithm in Python and made it available as an open-source project. The algorithm is easy to use and can be used to count crowds in a variety of applications.
